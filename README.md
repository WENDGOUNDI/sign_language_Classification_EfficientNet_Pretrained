# sign_language_Classification_EfficientNet_Pretrained
Sign language or signed language is a natural language defined by the usage of visual gestures. It is used by deaf communities and can differ from a country to another one. Sign languages can represent alphabet,
numbers or a whole word. In this project, we will use artificial intelligence to learn numbers representation (from 0 to 9) in american sign language. The learning model backbone is a pretrained EfficientNetB0. In addition we will use Gradio, a friendly UI component
for machine learning test deployment.

Why EfficienNet?
EfficienNet is a powerful deep network introduce by Tan and Le, that achieved State-of-the-Art accuracy on both ImageNet (a benchmark dataset for image classification). 
Requiring less FLOPS for inference, it is widely used for image classification and transfer learning tasks. The network provide 8 variants going from EfficienNetB0 to EfficienNetB7.
